This is basically the same as YT-DLP, but with Cloudflare Warp restart functionality enabled.



WHY?
Because Youtube bans you if you download something from their fucking website. 



How to use it:

1 - Install Python 3.9 or 3.10 (tested on 3.10).

2 - Install FFMPEG

3 - Install warp-cli.

3.5 - OPEN A FUCKING TERMINAL AND RUN warp-cli connect 

4 - Clone and run yt-dlp.sh with the parametrs you'd like to use.



If you want to build it, I don't know why - instructions are the same as in the original repo.
